# Rubiks' cube in OpenGL
## End goal: Rubiks' cube that can be rotated along all axes
### Minimum: rotation on one row

# Breakdown
 - Rendering a face
 - Making said face rotate
 - Make face 'tied to a cube' that is, it follows wherever it goes
 - Making a system where all cubes are rendered as part of a bigger object in code
 - Applying rotation on one row
 - Applying rotation on all rows (inputting notations maybe?)

 ### Notation: R for right hand rotation and R' for counter-clockwise etc.

 # Bugs
 - Resizing in i3
